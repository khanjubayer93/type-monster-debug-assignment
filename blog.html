        <h3>What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h3>
        <p>localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning, not all legacy browsers will support them)
            and are
            near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as
            the name
            suggests) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is deleted when the tab or window
            is closed) -
            it does, however, survive page reloads.

            Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is
            preferable to
            sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so you should not rely on the
            continuing
            existence of data in either case.

            localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client scripts
            between pages
            (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily
            be read or
            changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or
            security-related data
            within applications.</p>

        <h3>What is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>
        <p>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's
            controlled by the
            global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like.</p>
